/*
package tx contains generic Signable implementations that can be used
by your application or tests to handle authentication needs.

It currently supports transaction data as opaque bytes and either single
or multiple private key signatures using straightforward algorithms.
It currently does not support N-of-M key share signing of other more
complex algorithms (although it would be great to add them)
